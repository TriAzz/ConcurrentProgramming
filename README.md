# SIT315 Concurrent and Distributed Programming

This repository stores and showcases the results of completing tasks in Deakin University's SIT315 Concurrent and Distributed Programming course by Thomas Fleming.

## Course Overview

SIT315 focuses on the principles and practices of concurrent and distributed programming, covering topics such as:
- Multi-threading and parallel processing
- Interrupt handling and real-time systems
- Distributed system architectures
- Synchronization and communication mechanisms

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by modules and tasks:

- `module_1_task_1/` - Arduino Multi-Sensor Interrupt System
  - Implementation of a multi-sensor system using Pin Change Interrupts and Timer Interrupts
  - Features PIR sensors with LED color indication and timer-based mode switching

## Projects

### Module 1 Task 1: Arduino Multi-Sensor Interrupt System
A comprehensive Arduino project demonstrating interrupt handling with PIR sensors and RGB LED control. The system alternates between sensor-driven and timer-driven modes, showcasing real-time programming concepts.
