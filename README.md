# SIT315 Concurrent and Distributed Programming Repository

This repository is a combination of modules and tasks created as part of Deakin University's SIT315 Concurrent and Distributed Programming unit.

## Repository Structure

- **module_1_task_1**: Arduino Multi-Sensor Interrupt System
  - Demonstrates interrupt handling and sensor integration using Arduino.

- **module_2_task_1**: Parallel Matrix Multiplication
  - Implements and analyzes matrix multiplication using serial, pthread, and OpenMP approaches.

- **module_2_task_2**: Parallel QuickSort
  - Compares sequential and OpenMP-based parallel implementations of QuickSort.

- **module_2_task_3**: Traffic Simulator
  - Simulates traffic flow using sequential and parallel (OpenMP) methods.

- **module_3_task_1**: Distributed Matrix Multiplication
  - Explores distributed and heterogeneous matrix multiplication using MPI, OpenMP, and OpenCL.

- **module_3_task_2**: Distributed QuickSort
  - Analyzes distributed and heterogeneous implementations of QuickSort using MPI and OpenCL.

Each module contains code, documentation, and results relevant to the specific task, showcasing various concurrent and distributed programming techniques.
