# SIT315 Concurrent and Distributed Programming

This repository stores and showcases the results of completing tasks in Deakin University's SIT315 Concurrent and Distributed Programming course by Thomas Fleming.

## Course Overview

SIT315 focuses on the principles and practices of concurrent and distributed programming, covering topics such as:
- Multi-threading and parallel processing
- Interrupt handling and real-time systems
- Distributed system architectures
- Synchronization and communication mechanisms

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by modules and tasks:

- `module_1_task_1/` - Arduino Multi-Sensor Interrupt System
  - Implementation of a multi-sensor system using Pin Change Interrupts and Timer Interrupts
  - Features PIR sensors with LED color indication and timer-based mode switching

- `module_2_task_1/` - Parallel Matrix Multiplication
  - Performance analysis comparing serial, pthread, and OpenMP implementations
  - Demonstrates the effects of parallelization on different matrix sizes and thread counts

## Projects

### Module 1 Task 1: Arduino Multi-Sensor Interrupt System
A comprehensive Arduino project demonstrating interrupt handling with PIR sensors and RGB LED control. The system alternates between sensor-driven and timer-driven modes, showcasing real-time programming concepts.

### Module 2 Task 1: Parallel Matrix Multiplication
A detailed performance evaluation of parallel matrix multiplication implementations using both pthread and OpenMP. The project analyzes speedup characteristics across different matrix sizes and thread configurations, demonstrating when parallelization provides benefits and when overhead dominates performance.
